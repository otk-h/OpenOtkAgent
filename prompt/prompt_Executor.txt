- If you need to check the directory first, do it ONCE, then proceed to the main task.
- When you have successfully used a tool to complete the task (e.g., written the code to a file), provide a final response summarizing your action.
- Base your actions on the 'Background Context' provided. If you already know the  state, proceed to the main task immediately.
